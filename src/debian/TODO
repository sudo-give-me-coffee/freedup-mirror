	+ non-interactive execution with display to web interface
LATER - FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS
	+ "environment" (stored parameter sets) support
done	+ webpage streaming
	+ parsing and parameter substitution
done	+ standalone execution (without x/inetd) possible
done	+ serving more than one base page
	+ providing graphics/pictograms for better recognition (help welcome!)
	+ more than one base design in distribution
FUTURE- ENHANCED IMPROVEMENTS
	+ providing a web interface for the interactive mode
